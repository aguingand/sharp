# Building the menu

The Sharp side menu can contain several links, organized as you want.

<div style="text-align: center">

<img width="250" src="./img/menu.png" alt="Menu">

</div>

All links shares common things:

- an icon (from [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/icons/))
- a label
- and a URL

Links can be grouped in categories, like Company, Travels and Admin in this example.

The menu can be defined in two ways: either programmatically, in a dedicated class (recommended), or directly in the config file (legacy method).

## Create a SharpMenu class (preferred option)

### Write and declare the class

The class must extend `Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu`, and define a required `build()` method:

```php
class MySharpMenu extends Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu
{
    public function build(): self
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

And should be declared in the config file:

```php
// sharp.php

[...]
"menu" => MySharpMenu::class
```

### Link to an entity list, a dashboard or to a single show

```php
class MySharpMenu extends Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu
{
    public function build(): self
    {
        return $this
            ->addEntityLink("person", "People", "fas fa-user")
            ->addEntityLink("feature", "Features", "fas fa-superpowers");
    }
}
```

Given that `feature` and 'person' should be entities defined in the config file. Sharp will create a link either to the Entity List, to the dashboard or to a [single Show Page](single-show.md) (depending on the entity configuration).

### Link to an external URL

```php
class MySharpMenu extends Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu
{
    public function build(): self
    {
        return $this->addExternalLink("https://google.com", "Some external link", "fas fa-globe");
    }
}
```

### Group links in sections

Sections are groups that can be collapsed

```php
class MySharpMenu extends Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu
{
    public function build(): self
    {
        return $this
            ->addSection("Admin", function(SharpMenuItemSection $section) {
                $section
                    ->addEntityLink("account", "My account", "fas fa-user")
                    ->addEntityLink("user", "Sharp users", "fas fa-user-secret");
            });
    }
}
```

### Add separators in categories

You can add a simple labelled separator in categories, as sub-categories

```php
class MySharpMenu extends Code16\Sharp\Utils\Menu\SharpMenu
{
    public function build(): self
    {
        return $this
            ->addSection("Admin", function(SharpMenuItemSection $section) {
                $section
                    ->addEntityLink("account", "My account", "fas fa-user")
                    ->addSeparator("Other users")
                    ->addEntityLink("user", "Sharp users", "fas fa-user-secret");
            });
    }
}
```

## Define the menu directly in the config file (legacy)

### Link to an entity list

```php
// sharp.php

[...]
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Features",
        "icon" => "fa-superpowers",
        "entity" => "feature"
    ]
]
```

The `entity` value must correspond to some entity key described in the same `sharp.php` file.

### Link to a single entity show

```php
// sharp.php

[...]
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Account",
        "icon" => "fa-user",
        "entity" => "account",
        "single" => true
    ]
]
```

The `single => true` attribute would mean Sharp will create a link towards a `SharpSingleShow` implementation for the entity `account`. See [doc related to Shows](single-show.md). 

### Link to a dashboard

Very similar to entity lists, except that `entity` is replaced by a `dashboard` attribute which must contain a valid dashboard key:

```php
// sharp.php

[...]
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Dashboard",
        "icon" => "fa-dashboard",
        "dashboard" => "company_dashboard"
    ]
]
```

### Link to an external URL

```php
// sharp.php

[...]
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Some external link",
        "icon" => "fa-globe",
        "url" => "https://google.com"
    ]
]
```

### Group links in categories

Categories are groups that can be collapsed

```php
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Company",
        "entities" => [
            [
                "label" => "Dashboard",
                "icon" => "fa-dashboard",
                "dashboard" => "company_dashboard"
            ],
            [
                "label" => "Spaceships",
                "icon" => "fa-space-shuttle",
                "entity" => "spaceship"
            ],
            [...]
        ]
    ]
]
```

### Add separators in categories

You can add a simple labelled separator in categories, as sub-categories

```php
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Company",
        "entities" => [
            [
                "label" => "Dashboard",
                "icon" => "fa-dashboard",
                "dashboard" => "company_dashboard"
            ],
            [
                "separator" => true,
                "label" => "Separator",
            ],
            [
                "label" => "Spaceships",
                "icon" => "fa-space-shuttle",
                "entity" => "spaceship"
            ],
            [...]
        ]
    ]
]
```
