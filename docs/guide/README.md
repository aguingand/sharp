# Getting started

## Terminology, general concept

In Sharp, we handle `entities`; an `entity` is simply a data structure which has a meaning in the application context. For instance, a `Person`, a `Post` or an `Order`. In the Eloquent world, for which Sharp is optimized, it's typically a Model â€” but it's not necessarily a 1-1 relationship, a Sharp `entity` can represent a portion of a Model, or several Models.

Each instance of an `entity` is called... an `instance`.

Each `entity` in Sharp can be displayed:
- in an `Entity List`, which is the list of all the `instances` for this `entity`: with some configuration and code, the user can sort the data, add filters, pagination, and perform searches. From there we also gain access to applicative `commands` applied either to an `instance` or to the whole (filtered) list, and to a simple `state` changer (the published state of an Article, for instance). All of that is described below.
- In a `Show Page`, optionally, to display an `instance` details.
- And in a `Form`, either to update or create a new `instance`.

## Installation

Sharp 7 needs Laravel 8+ and PHP 8+.

- Add the package with composer: `composer require code16/sharp`
- And then publish assets: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets`

A tip on this last command: you'll need fresh assets each time Sharp is updated, so a good practice is to add the command in the `scripts.post-autoload-dump` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    [...]
    "post-autoload-dump": [
        "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
        "@php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Code16\\Sharp\\SharpServiceProvider --tag=assets --force",
        "@php artisan package:discover"
    ]
},
```

## Configuration

Sharp needs a `config/sharp.php` config file, mainly to declare `entities`. 

You can initialize this file with `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=config`

Here's an example:

```php
return [
    "entities" => [
        "spaceship" => \App\Sharp\Entities\SpaceshipEntity::class,
    ]
];
```

This `SpaceshipSharpEntity` class could be written like this:

```php
class SpaceshipEntity extends SharpEntity
{
    protected ?string $list = SpaceshipSharpList::class;
    protected ?string $show = SpaceshipSharpShow::class;
    protected ?string $form = SpaceshipSharpForm::class;
    protected ?string $policy = SpaceshipSharpPolicy::class;
    protected string $label = "Spaceship";
}
```

We choose to define:

- a `list` class, responsible for the `Entity List`,
- a `show` class, responsible for displaying an `instance`,
- a `form` class, responsible for the create and edit `Form`,
- and a `policy` class, for authorization.

Almost each one is optional, in fact: we could skip the `show` and go straight to the `form` from the `list`, for instance. 

We'll get into all those classes in this document. The important thing to notice is that Sharp provides base classes to handle all the wiring (and more), but as we'll see, the applicative code is totally up to you.

## Access to Sharp

Once installed, Sharp is accessible via the url `/sharp`, by default. If you wish to change this default value, you'll need to define the `custom_url_segment` config value, in `config/sharp.php`:

```php
return [
    "name" => "Saturn",
    "custom_url_segment" => "admin",
    [...]
]
```
