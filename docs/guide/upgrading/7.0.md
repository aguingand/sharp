# Upgrading from 6.x to 7.x

Due to an extensive refactoring aiming to improve DX, there is many breaking changes in the API... But stay with me, it's mainly function renaming and new arguments. 

## Get new assets, clear cache

This is true for every update: be sure to grab the latest assets and to clear the view cache:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets
php artisan view:clear
```

## Laravel 8+ and php 8.0+ required

It's not a BC, but still, minimal requirements are now these.

## Type hinting everywhere (part II)

In order to reinforce the API, we decided to use PHP type hinting everywhere. Sharp 6 handled the big part, but with php 8.0 we could add a few that were missing.

## EntityListQueryParams is now an instance property of an EntityList 

This means that the `getListData()` function no longer has a `$params` argument, which must be replaced by `$this->queryParams`. This change makes it much easier to build the EntityList depending on the request (hide some columns for instance). 

## DashboardQueryParams is now an instance property of a Dashboard

Similarly, the `buildWidgetsData()` function no longer has a `$params` argument, which must be replaced by `$this->queryParams`.

## All configuration methods have now a name prefixed with `configure...`

The motivation for this was to provide a clear list of available methods for configuration to the developer. This could lead to many changes, but it's quite easy to fix them. Here's the full list of renamed methods:

Renamed methods of `SharpEntityList`:
- `setInstanceIdAttribute()` -> `configureInstanceIdAttribute()`
- `setSearchable()` -> `configureSearchable()`
- `setDefaultSort()` -> `configureDefaultSort()`
- `setPaginated()` -> `configurePaginated()`
- `setReorderable()` -> `configureReorderable()`
- `setPrimaryEntityCommand()` -> `configurePrimaryEntityCommand()`
- `setMultiformAttribute()` -> `configureMultiformAttribute()`

Renamed methods of `SharpForm`:
- `setDisplayShowPageAfterCreation()` -> `configureDisplayShowPageAfterCreation()`
- `setBreadcrumbCustomLabelAttribute()` -> `configureBreadcrumbCustomLabelAttribute()`

Renamed methods of `SharpShow`:
- `setMultiformAttribute()` -> `configureMultiformAttribute()`
- `setEntityState()` -> `configureEntityState()`
- `setBreadcrumbCustomLabelAttribute()` -> `configureBreadcrumbCustomLabelAttribute()`

Renamed methods of `Command`:
- `setConfirmationText()` -> `configureConfirmationText()`
- `setDescription()` -> `configureDescription()`
- `setFormModalTitle()` -> `configureFormModalTitle()`

## Add proxy objects for EntityList columns and layout

The idea is to provide dedicated objects when needed to clearly indicate the API to the developer.

### `buildListDataContainers()` is renamed to `buildListFields(EntityListFieldsContainer $fieldsContainer)`

The `$fieldsContainer` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addField(...)` function.
As a bonus, `EntityListDataContainer` was renamed `EntityListField` for clarity.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildListDataContainers(): void
{
    $this
        ->addDataContainer(
            EntityListDataContainer::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        )
        ->addDataContainer(
            EntityListDataContainer::make("age")
                ->setLabel("Age")
        );
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildListFields(EntityListFieldsContainer $fieldsContainer): void
{
    $fieldsContainer
        ->addField(
            EntityListField::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        )
        ->addField(
            EntityListField::make("age")
                ->setLabel("Age")
        );
}
```

### `buildListLayout()` signature has changed to `buildListLayout(EntityListFieldsLayout $fieldsLayout)`

The `$fieldsLayout` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addColumn(...)` function.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildListLayout(): void
{
    $this->addColumn("picture", 1)
        ->addColumn("name", 2)
        ->addColumn("capacity", 2)
        ->addColumn("type:label", 2)
        ->addColumn("pilots")
        ->addColumn("messages_sent_count");
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildListLayout(EntityListFieldsLayout $fieldsLayout): void
{
    $fieldsLayout->addColumn("picture", 1)
        ->addColumn("name", 2)
        ->addColumn("capacity", 2)
        ->addColumn("type:label", 2)
        ->addColumn("pilots")
        ->addColumn("messages_sent_count");
}
```

### EntityList's `->addColumn()` no longer has optional parameter for small screens

Instead, a new optional `buildListLayoutForSmallScreens()` is available. [Refer to doc](../building-entity-list.md) for details.

## Add proxy objects for Form fields and layout

### `buildFormFields()` is renamed to `buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields)`

The `$formFields` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addField(...)` function.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildFormFields(): void
{
    $this
        ->addField(
            SharpFormTextField::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        );
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields): void
{
    $formFields
        ->addField(
            SharpFormTextField::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        );
}
```

### `buildFormLayout()` signature has changed to `buildFormLayout(FormLayout $formLayout)`

The `$formLayout` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addTab(...)` and `->addColumn(...)` functions.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildFormLayout(): void
{
    $this
        ->addColumn(6, function(FormLayoutColumn $column) {
            return $column->withSingleField("name")
                ->withSingleField("email");
        });
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildFormLayout(FormLayout $formLayout): void
{
    $formLayout
        ->addColumn(6, function(FormLayoutColumn $column) {
            return $column->withSingleField("name")
                ->withSingleField("email");
        });
}
```

## Add proxy objects for Show fields and layout

### `buildShowFields()` is renamed to `buildShowFields(FieldsContainer $showFields)`

The `$showFields` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addField(...)` function.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildShowFields(): void
{
    $this
        ->addField(
            SharpShowTextField::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        );
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildShowFields(FieldsContainer $showFields): void
{
    $showFields
        ->addField(
            SharpShowTextField::make("name")
                ->setLabel("Name")
        );
}
```

### `buildShowLayout()` signature has changed to `buildShowLayout(ShowLayout $showLayout)`

The `$showLayout` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addSection(...)` and `->addEntityListSection(...)` functions.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildShowLayout(): void
{
    $this
        ->addSection("Identity", function(ShowLayoutSection $section) {
            $section
                ->addColumn(6, function(ShowLayoutColumn $column) {
                    $column->withSingleField("name");
                });
        });
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildShowLayout(ShowLayout $showLayout): void
{
    $showLayout
        ->addSection("Identity", function(ShowLayoutSection $section) {
            $section
                ->addColumn(6, function(ShowLayoutColumn $column) {
                    $column->withSingleField("name");
                });
        });
}
```

## Add proxy objects for Dashboard widgets and layout

### `buildWidgets()` is renamed to `buildWidgets(WidgetsContainer $widgetsContainer)`

The `$widgetsContainer` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addWidget(...)` function.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildWidgets(): void
{
    $this
        ->addWidget(
            SharpBarGraphWidget::make("travels")
        );
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildWidgets(WidgetsContainer $widgetsContainer): void
{
    $widgetsContainer
        ->addWidget(
            SharpBarGraphWidget::make("travels")
        );
}
```

### `buildWidgetsLayout()` signature has changed to `buildDashboardLayout(DashboardLayout $dashboardLayout)`

The `$dashboardLayout` parameter is a proxy object with the needed `->addRow(...)` and `->addFullWidthWidget(...)`
functions.

Example: you need to refactor you code from this:

```php
function buildWidgetsLayout(): void
{
    $this
        ->addRow(function(DashboardLayoutRow $row) {
            $row->addWidget(6, "types_pie")
                ->addWidget(6, "features_bars");
        });
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildDashboardLayout(DashboardLayout $dashboardLayout): void
{
    $dashboardLayout
        ->addRow(function(DashboardLayoutRow $row) {
            $row->addWidget(6, "types_pie")
                ->addWidget(6, "features_bars");
        });
}
```

## API changes on Commands

There are various changes on Commands, but it's mainly code reorganization and function renaming, for better clarity and
easier configuration.

### New Command declaration

Commands must now be declared in dedicated function: `getInstanceCommands()` (EntityList and Show Page)
, `getEntityCommands()` (EntityList), and `getDashboardCommands()` (Dashboard) â€” previously they were declared in
the `build...Config()` method.

For example, here's a 6.0 EntityList (everything in the `buildListConfig()` function):

```php
function buildListConfig(): void
{
    $this->setInstanceIdAttribute("id")
        ->setSearchable()
        ->setDefaultSort("name", "asc")
        ->addFilter("type", SpaceshipTypeFilter::class)
        ->addFilter("pilots", SpaceshipPilotsFilter::class)
        ->addEntityCommand("synchronize", SpaceshipSynchronize::class)
        ->addEntityCommand("reload", SpaceshipReload::class)
        ->addInstanceCommand("message", SpaceshipSendMessage::class)
        ->addInstanceCommand("preview", SpaceshipPreview::class)
        ->addInstanceCommandSeparator()
        ->addInstanceCommand("external", SpaceshipExternalLink::class);
}
```

And the same EntityList in 7.0: Commands are no longer in the `buildListConfig` function:

```php
function getEntityCommands(): ?array
{
    return [
        new SpaceshipSynchronize(),
        SpaceshipReload::class
    ];
}

function getInstanceCommands(): ?array
{
    return [
        SpaceshipSendMessage::class,
        new SpaceshipPreview(),
        "---",
        SpaceshipExternalLink::class
    ];
}

function buildListConfig(): void
{
    $this->configureInstanceIdAttribute("id")
        ->configureSearchable()
        ->configureDefaultSort("name", "asc");
}
```

Also notice that:
- the Command key is now optional
- the Command separator is a string made of dashes (one is enough)
- Filters were removed as well, see dedicated section below in this guide

**This applies in every class that leverage Commands: EntityList, Show Page and Dashboard.**

### new `buildCommandConfig()` method + removal of old functions: `->description()`, `->confirmationText()`...

In 6.0, some Command configuration was done overriding some methods, without really knowing which ones are concerned. In 7.0, a new  `buildCommandConfig()` is here to handle all configuration.

Here's a 6.0 example:

```php
class TravelSendEmail extends InstanceCommand
{
    public function label(): string
    {
        return "Send email";
    }

    public function formModalTitle(): string
    {
        return "Send email";
    }

    public function description(): string
    {
        return "Will pretend to send an email to all the passengers of this flight.";
    }
    
    [...]
}
```

And its 7.0 version:

```php
class class TravelSendEmail extends InstanceCommand
{
    public function label(): string
    {
        return "Send email";
    }
    
    public function buildCommandConfig(): void
    {
        $this->configureFormModalTitle("Send email")
            ->configureDescription("Will pretend to send an email to all the passengers of this flight.");
    }
    
    [...]
}
```

### New proxy object for form building

Exactly like for SharpForm (see above), you need to go from this in 6.0: 

```php
public function buildFormFields(): void
{
    $this
        ->addField(
            SharpFormTextField::make("subject")
                ->setLabel("Subject")
    );
}
```

To this in 7.0:

```php
public function buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields): void
{
    $formFields
        ->addField(
            SharpFormTextField::make("subject")
                ->setLabel("Subject")
    );
}
```

## Changes on Filters

### Base Filters are no longer interfaces, but abstract classes

... so you need to change all `implements SelectFilter` (for instance) to `extends SelectFilter`.

### New Filter declaration

Similar to Commands, Filters must now be declared in dedicated function: `getFilters()`.

For example, here's a 6.0 EntityList (everything in the `buildListConfig()` function):

```php
function buildListConfig(): void
{
    $this->setInstanceIdAttribute("id")
        ->setSearchable()
        ->setDefaultSort("name", "asc")
        ->addFilter("type", SpaceshipTypeFilter::class)
        ->addFilter("pilots", SpaceshipPilotsFilter::class);
}
```

To this:

```php
function getFilters(): ?array
{
    return [
        SpaceshipTypeFilter::class,
        new SpaceshipPilotsFilter() // Filters can be declared as class name or instances 
    ];
}

function buildListConfig(): void
{
    $this->configureInstanceIdAttribute("id")
        ->configureSearchable()
        ->configureDefaultSort("name", "asc");
}
```

Also notice that the Filter keys (type and pilots, in this example) disappeared

**This applies in all classes that leverage Filters: EntityList and Dashboard.**

### No more filter key: update your queries

Like seen in the previous point, the string key has been removed for simplicity and to avoid mistakes. So in Sharp 7.0, to extract a filter value from the query params, you'll need to provide the filter's class name.

For example:

```php
function getListData(): array|Arrayable
{
    $pilot = $this->queryParams->filterFor(SpaceshipPilotFilter::class);
    [...]
}
```

### New `buildFilterConfig()` method + removal of all old functions: `->isSearchable()`, `->isMaster()`, `->template()`...

Like other classes in Sharp, Filters now have a dedicated `buildFilterConfig()` method to group all configuration calls. And since we moved from interfaces to abstract classes, it's easier to find all available options with IDE autocompletion: all option methods start with `configure[...]()`.

For example:

```php
public function buildFilterConfig(): void
{
    $this->configureLabel("Ship type")
        ->configureSearchable()
        ->configureRetainInSession();
}
```

### Changes on global filters configuration

Global filters no longer need keys (in the configuration, where they are declared):

```php
// in config/sharp.php

return [
    [...],
    "global_filters" => [
        CorporationGlobalFilter::class,
    ]
];
```

Also update your queries accordingly, using full class name instead of key, like for other fields:

```php
function getListData(): array|Arrayable
{
    $spaceships = Spaceship::select("spaceships.*")
        ->where("corporation_id", currentSharpRequest()->globalFilterFor(CorporationGlobalFilter::class))
        ->get();
    [...]
}
```

### The `callback()` filter feature was removed

This feature wasn't designed well. It may be replaced in the future is needed.

## Markdown editor refactoring 

### `SharpFormMarkdownField` and `SharpFormWysiwygField` where removed, and replace by `SharpFormEditorField`

The two fields were united in one, with the same UX. To migrate a field, you must change its class and add `->setRenderContentAsMarkdown()` is necessary:

Example: you need to refactor your SharpFormMarkdownField from this:

```php
function buildFormFields(): void
{
    $this
        ->addField(
            SharpFormMarkdownField::make("description")
                ->setLabel("Description")
                ->setToolbar([
                    SharpFormMarkdownField::B, 
                    SharpFormMarkdownField::I,
                    SharpFormMarkdownField::A,
                ])
                ->setHeight(700)
        );
}
```

To this:

```php
function buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields): void
{
    $formFields
        ->addField(
            SharpFormEditorField::make("description")
                ->setRenderContentAsMarkdown()
                ->setLabel("Description")
                ->setToolbar([
                    SharpFormEditorField::B, 
                    SharpFormEditorField::I,
                    SharpFormEditorField::A,
                ])
                ->setHeight(700)
        );
}
```

Same for SharpFormWysiwygField, except for the `->setRenderContentAsMarkdown()`.

### The `MarkdownAttributeTransformer` no more has a dedicated method to handle embedded images

If you allow embed images in a markdown field, previously you would have to call `->handleImages()` on the
transformer to configure image embedding: this is now implied, due to the `<x-sharp-media>` refactoring. 
Simply remove this call.

Before:

```
function find($id): array
{
    return $this
        ->setCustomTransformer(
            "description", 
            (new MarkdownAttributeTransformer())->handleImages(200)
        )
        ->transform([...]);
}
```

After:

```
function find($id): array
{
    return $this
        ->setCustomTransformer(
            "description", 
            new MarkdownAttributeTransformer()
        )
        ->transform([...]);
}
```

### How to display markdown with embed files and images with helpers has changed

If you allow embed images or files in a markdown field, previously you would need to use respectively `sharp_markdown_thumbnails()`
and `sharp_markdown_embedded_files()` to display embedded images and files in the public site. Those two helpers were
removed.

You now need to replace them by the new `<x-sharp-content>` component: [see dedicated documentation](../form-fields/editor.md#configuration).

Before with embed images:
```
<div>
    {!! sharp_markdown_thumbnails($object->my_markdown_field, "mw-100", 775) !!}
</div>
```
or with embed files:
```
<div>
    {!! sharp_markdown_embedded_files($object->my_markdown_field) !!}
</div>
```

After:
```
<div>
    <x-sharp-content>
        {!! $object->my_markdown_field !!}
    </x-sharp-content>
</div>
```

### Handle existing data

If you allow embed images or files in a markdown field, you probably stored them in database.
With previous format, markdown with embed objects looked something like this:

```
# My title
Some text
![](local:/data/img/markdown/my_image.jpg)
More text
![](local:/data/img/markdown/my_document.pdf)
```

Due to the `<x-sharp-media>` refactoring, markdown with embed objects looks something like:

```
# My title
Some text
<x-sharp-image name="my_image.jpg" path="data/img/markdown/my_image.jpg" disk="local">
</x-sharp-image>
More text
<x-sharp-file name="my_document.pdf" path="data/files/markdown/my_document.pdf" disk="local">
</x-sharp-file>
```

If you want to keep displaying old markdown, you will have to convert embed objects from old to new format in all your stored markdown fields. This could be achieved manually or automated with a custom script based on [preg_replace_callback](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace-callback.php).

## New Entity classes (SharpEntity) 

Sharp 7 brings a new config format, along with the SharpEntity. In short, this means the `sharp.php` config file is lighter since all the entity config (list, form, policy, show...) is now declared in a dedicated entity class. This is [fully documented here](../entity-class.md), and it's NOT A BREAKING CHANGE, since the legacy config format is still handled with Sharp 7 (but it's clearly deprecated).

### New config format

In the config of a Sharp 7 project, we just declare a SharpEntity class for entities and dashboard:

```php
// config/sharp.php
return [
    // ...
    "entities" => [
        "spaceship" => \App\Sharp\Entities\SpaceshipEntity::class,
        "pilot" => \App\Sharp\Entities\PilotEntity::class,
    ],

    "dashboards" => [
        "company_dashboard" => \App\Sharp\Entities\CompanyDashboardEntity::class,
    ],
    //...
];
```

`SharpEntity`'s subclasses are responsible for the list, form, show... declaration ([see documentation](../entity-class.md)). Note that as stated before, you can keep the old declaration way in the config file, or even mix the new and old methods, but the old one is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.

### Impact on Validators

Validators declaration moved from config file to where it belongs, in the Form itself:

```php
class SpaceshipSharpForm extends SharpForm
{
    protected ?string $formValidatorClass = SpaceshipSharpValidator::class;
    
    // ...
}
```

See [related documentation](../building-form.md#input-validation), and do note that the Sharp 6 way of declare it (in config/sharp.php) is still handled as legacy (but deprecated).


### Impact on policies

Entity and Dashboard Policies must now extend `Code16\Sharp\Auth\SharpEntityPolicy`, where the methods slightly changed (typehinting mostly). This is not a BC, since the legacy Sharp 6 format is still handled, but it's deprecated.

The permission method to see a Dashboard was renamed from `view()` to `entity()`, to be consistent:

```php
class CompanyDashboardPolicy extends SharpEntityPolicy
{
    public function entity($user): bool
    {
        return $user->hasGroup("boss");
    }
}
```

### Impact on global authorizations

Like for policies, global authorizations were moved to the `SharpEntity` implementation, and renamed `$prohibitedActions` ([see documentation](../entity-class.md)). Legacy declaration is still handled, except on one point (which was kinda buggy anyway): it's not possible to declare a global authorization to be `true`, meaning you can only globally forbid actions. The new `$prohibitedActions` is way clearer on this.

## New way of configure the Menu 

Sharp 7 introduce a new way of defining the Menu: in a class instead of in the config file. This is [documented here](../building-menu.md), and do note that the Sharp 6 way is still supported.


## Changes on testing

### Commands should be called via class name

As a result of the Command declaration refactoring, you may now use the full command class name instead of its key to
test it:

```php
$this
    ->callSharpInstanceCommandFromList(
        "spaceship", 22, SpaceshipSendMessage::class
    )
    ->assertOk();
```
