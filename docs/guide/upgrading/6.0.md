# Upgrading from 5.x to 6.x

This version brings more breaking changes than the previous ones, since we decided to clean up old code parts and to fully embrace PHP 7.x type hinting.

## Laravel 7+ and php 7.4+ required

It's not a BC, but still, minimal requirements are now these.

## Type hinting everywhere

In order to reinforce the API, we decided to use PHP type hinting everywhere (well, almost everywhere). This means that you'll have to add parameters and return types on EntityLists, Forms, Shows, Filters, Commands, EntityStates...

## Sharp URLs changed

Not sure it's really a BC, unless you use direct links to a Sharp EntityList, Show, or Form in a notification for instance. Anyways all URLs changed as a consequence of the new breadcrumb feature.

## `LinkToEntity` must be replaced by `LinkTo[XXX]` classes

The 5.0 LinkToEntity class has been removed in favor of:
- LinkToEntityList
- LinkToForm
- LinkToShowPage
- LinkToSingleForm
- LinkToSingleShowPage

See [related documentation](../link-to.md).

## `SharpWidget::setLink()` changed its parameters

This method is now expecting a [`LinkTo[XXX]` instance](../link-to.md).

```php
    SharpPanelWidget::make("activeSpaceships")
        ->setInlineTemplate("<h1>{{count}}</h1> spaceships in activity")
        ->setLink(LinkToEntityList::make("spaceship"));
```

## The Closure of `SharpOrderedListWidget::buildItemLink()` changed its parameters

In order to use the new `LinkTo[XXX]` classes, the Closure is now expected to either return a string (URL) or a [`LinkTo[XXX]` instance](../link-to.md).

```php
    SharpOrderedListWidget::make("widget")
        ->buildItemLink(function($item) {
            return LinkToEntityList::make("entity")->addFilter("type", $item['id']); 
        });
```

## `SharpContext` was removed in favor of `CurrentSharpRequest`

The `Code16\Sharp\Http\Context\SharpContext` class and the `Code16\Sharp\Http\WithSharpContext` trait were removed. If you need to know the current context, use the new `Code16\Sharp\Http\Context\CurrentSharpRequest` class, [documented here](../context.md).

## Deprecated filter classes were removed

`EntityListFilter`, `EntityListMultipleFilter`, `EntityListRequiredFilter`, `DashboardFilter`, `DashboardRequiredFilter`, `DashboardMultipleFilter`, which were deprecated in 5.x, were removed (and replaced by `EntityLostSelectFilter`, `EntityListSelectMultipleFilter`, `EntityListSelectRequiredFilter` ...).

## `SharpUploadModelAttributeTransformer` class was removed

I was used to EntityList as an attribute transformer in EntityList, for SharpUploadModel. In 6.x, you should used in replacement:

`->setCustomTransformer("picture", (new SharpUploadModelThumbnailUrlTransformer(100))->renderAsImageTag())`

## `sharp_markdown_thumbnails()` helper is now deprecated

Replaced by `sharp_markdown_embedded_files()`, to take benefit of the feature of file embeds in the Markdown field (see [documentation](../form-fields/editor.md)).

## `EntityState` color const are deprecated

`PRIMARY_COLOR`, `SECONDARY_COLOR`, ... are deprecated.
For the primary color, use the new config `config('sharp.theme.primary_color')`.  

For other legacy colors, replace with the following hex code:
Const | Color Hex
---|---
PRIMARY_COLOR | `"#5596E6"`
SECONDARY_COLOR | `"#FD7400"`
GRAY_COLOR | `"#8C9BA5"`
LIGHTGRAY_COLOR | `"#EFF2F5"`
DARKGRAY_COLOR | `"#394B54"`
